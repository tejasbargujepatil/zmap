#zmap Ultimate Port Scanner

Welcome to the **Port Scanner** project, a powerful tool designed for network analysis and security assessments. This Python-based scanner allows you to discover open ports and services on a target host, making it an essential utility for network administrators and security professionals.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Scanning**: Quickly scan multiple ports simultaneously for enhanced performance.
- **Asynchronous Scanning**: Leverage Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O operations to maximize efficiency.
- **Service Detection**: Identify services running on open ports with basic banner grabbing.
- **UDP Scanning**: Detect open UDP ports and their status.
- **Detailed Logging**: Automatic logging of scan results and errors for future reference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive command-line interface to guide users through the scanning process.
